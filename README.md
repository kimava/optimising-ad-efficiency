## Background
The client runs an online store on Naver Store (similar to Google Shopping). They want to improve ad efficiency, as they believe it has declined.

- **Analysis Data Collection Period:** December 1-14, 2024 (14 days)
- **Business Proposal Test Period:** January 6-19, 2025 (14 days)
- **Key limitations:**
  - Only CPC-based search ads are being used, with no plans to increase the ad budget.
  - CPC optimisation tools are already in place, and CPC data was not provided due to company confidentiality.
  - The price of each product has already been fixed.
  - Currently, the same amount was allocated to each product's ad.

## Analysis Approach / Framework
To achieve the goal of **increasing ad efficiency** for the client, we focus on **ROAS (Return on Ad Spend)** because it directly measures the revenue generated per unit of advertising investment, helping us assess the effectiveness of ad spend in driving sales.

## Key Recommendations
- **Increase Conversion Rate:** Reallocate the budget to the best performing products, while investigating the worst performing products to increase conversion rate.
  - Allocate a larger portion of the budget to Facial Cream and Shampoo given their high performance to increase conversion rate.
  - Conducting deep-dives into the Facial Cleanser ad to identify the root cause of its 0% conversion rate.

- **Increase Order Size:** Leverage selling strategies to optimise conversion revenue.
  - Implement order enhancing strategies (e.g., up-selling, cross-selling) to increase the current average order size from 1 to optimise conversion revenue.

- **Increase Click-Through Rate:** Focus on the media channels with the highest CTR to improve performance.
  - Reallocate the budget to Naver Search media channel with highest CTR, while excluding bottom 6 media channels to improve budget efficiency.
