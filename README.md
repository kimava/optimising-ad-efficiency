## Background
The client runs an online store on Naver Store (similar to Google Shopping). They want to improve ad efficiency, as they believe it has declined.

- **Analysis Data Collection Period:** December 1-14, 2024 (14 days)
- **Business Proposal Test Period:** January 6-19, 2025 (14 days)
- **Key limitations:**
  - Only CPC-based search ads are being used, with no plans to increase the ad budget.
  - CPC optimisation tools are already in place, and CPC data was not provided due to company confidentiality.
  - The price of each product has already been fixed.
  - Currently, the same amount was allocated to each product's ad.

<br/>

## Analysis Approach / Framework
To achieve the goal of **increasing ad efficiency** for the client, we focus on **ROAS (Return on Ad Spend)** because it directly measures the revenue generated per unit of advertising investment, helping us assess the effectiveness of ad spend in driving sales.

## Key Recommendations
- **Increase Conversion Rate:** Reallocate the budget to the best performing products, while investigating the worst performing products to increase conversion rate.
  - Allocate a larger portion of the budget to Facial Cream and Shampoo given their high performance to increase conversion rate.
  - Conducting deep-dives into the Facial Cleanser ad to identify the root cause of its 0% conversion rate.

- **Increase Order Size:** Leverage selling strategies to optimise conversion revenue.
  - Implement order enhancing strategies (e.g., up-selling, cross-selling) to increase the current average order size from 1 to optimise conversion revenue.

- **Increase Click-Through Rate:** Focus on the media channels with the highest CTR to improve performance.
  - Reallocate the budget to Naver Search media channel with highest CTR, while excluding bottom 6 media channels to improve budget efficiency.

The pivot table is structured to provide insights into conversion rates by product, average order size per product, and CTR by media channel, with separate sheets for each analysis.
